                    <p>I'm a graduate of full stack web development at Le Wagon, London Batch 599. Currently looking
                    for my first role in web development. At the moment, I'm learning the React library whilst working on wireframe for
                    a vintage brand and also a nutritional fitness company. Previous to getting into coding I worked in retail management
                    for 10 + years where I delivered the brand's aesthetic in-store through visual graphics and videos whilst managing service
                    and sales. </p>
